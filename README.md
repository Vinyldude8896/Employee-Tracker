# Employee-Tracker

### User Story
As a user I need a command line application that will keep track of my company and it's employees. By answer command prompt questions I would like to be able to view my departments, my employees and their roles. As a user I also want the ability to Create a new Department, or Delete a department. As a user I would also like the ability to update a role that an employee has. As a user I would also like to be able to add or delete an employee. When I ask to add an employee, I should be prompted to enter the employee's Name and department and their role. Then when I view employees it should return their name, ID, Role, Department and salary as well as the ID of their manager.
### Features

This app will prompt the user with a menu to :
View all employees

When a user inputs the requested data the appropriate CRUD(Create, Read, Update or Delete) action is applied to the databse.
